1. We would not use a unit test to test messaging between two users because the point of a unit test is that it cannot test how indivdiual components interact with each other on a feature level.
2. We can certainly test the max message length of a message application, because we can isolate the component separately and create stress tests to put the property through to analyze its outcome.
